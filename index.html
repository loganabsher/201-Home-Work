        <h2 id="Story">Story time:</h2>
        <p>I figured since my bio is extremely lame and I don't have much to say about myself I'll tell a story instead.</p>
        <p>About 8 or 9 years ago I was apart of a scout troop. We were camping deep in the forests of Mt. Baker, and on this camp outing we had a new scout join our troop. He seemed nice enough at first, but a few days into our outing we were cooking bacon over a fire sometime in the morning, and the new scout was talking with another scout. It sarted friendly enough with the standerd, "hey how was your morning" etc. But then I hear my friend behind me say jokingly, "hey, I'll fight you over who gets to cook bacon next." The new scout replies "SURE!" and proceeds to knock the other scout to the ground and start stomping on his face. The other scout manages to get up out of the bush he was laying in and hit the new scout in the face giving him a pretty bad bloody nose, and causing the new scout to run into the foliage towards the main path crying. Me, having no idea what was going on, began to ask Aiden what happened. Keep in mind all the other scouts had run off to play capture the flag so it was only us three at the camp site. As he was explaining the fight to me as we were walking towards the main path and when we turned the corner we saw the new scout. He had an axe in his hands. The one we were using to clear a tree that fell into the path. He started screaming and hitting the axe into the ground, and he began walking towards us. After a few steps and out of no where, like a NFL pass rusher, one of the senior scouts just totally blindside tackles the psyco. A few other senior scouts come from their camp site to hold him down and in what seemed like seconds an ambulance arrived and they took him away in a stretcher. Once all the crazienss had subsided we noticed that Aiden had peed his pants and proceeded to make fun of him for the remainer of our outing. That is the story of how I was nearly axe murdered, and the reason I quit scouts.</p>
